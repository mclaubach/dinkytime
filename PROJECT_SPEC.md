# BabyTime - Project Specification

## Project Overview
**BabyTime** is an immersive, web-based musical-visual jamming experience for babies and toddlers. Inspired by KidPix aesthetics and Blipblox synthesizers, it transforms keyboard mashing into a creative, multi-sensory art session that records and plays back the chaos.

## Core Concept
When a baby opens the app and starts pressing keys, they create a unique audio-visual composition. Each key triggers random combinations of:
- Synthesizer sounds and musical notes
- Visual canvas additions (shapes, symbols, words, animals, numbers)
- Animated effects (bouncing, moving, transforming elements)
- Background effects (color changes, sparkles, stars, gradients)
- Silly sound effects mixed with musical patterns

## Phase 1: Core Jamming Experience (Current Scope)
Focus exclusively on the jam session functionality. Gallery, sharing, and social features are Phase 2.

## Functional Requirements

### 1. Application Launch & Modal
- **Landing Modal**: On first visit, display a modal overlay on top of the canvas
  - Bright, fun, KidPix-style design
  - Clear "START JAM" button
  - Brief explanation of the concept (optional info toggle)
  - Modal sits on top of the canvas background
  
- **Starting a Jam**: Clicking "START JAM" dismisses modal and begins session

### 2. Jam Session Core Mechanics

#### Key Assignment System
- **Random Assignment**: On session start, randomly assign all keyboard keys to functions
- **Function Types**:
  - Musical synthesizer notes (various synth modes)
  - Percussion/beat triggers
  - Visual canvas painters (permanent additions)
  - Animated elements (temporary, moving)
  - Symbol/emoji spawners
  - Word generators (baby words like "BABA", "MAMA", "WOW")
  - Background effect triggers
  - Animal images/sounds
  - Shape generators
  - Number spawners
  - Color changers
  - Shader/WebGL effects
  
- **Mixed Functionality**: Some keys can trigger BOTH audio and visual simultaneously
- **Randomization Strategy**: Ensure a good mix of:
  - 40% musical/synth functions
  - 30% visual permanent additions
  - 20% animated effects
  - 10% background/shader effects

#### Audio Engine
- **Synthesizer Modes**:
  - Bass mode (low, rumbling tones)
  - Melody mode (mid to high range notes)
  - Percussion mode (drums, clicks, claps)
  - Chaos mode (glitchy, weird sounds)
  - Mixed mode (combination of above)
  
- **Sound Effects Library**: Include silly sounds:
  - Boings, lasers, zaps
  - Animal sounds (no dinosaurs!)
  - Bubbles, pops, whooshes
  - Baby giggles, silly voices
  - Musical instruments (toy-like)
  
- **Beat/Pattern Engine**: 
  - Some keys trigger looping beats that drive the session
  - Patterns can layer and combine
  - Tempo randomized per session (keep it upbeat)

#### Visual Engine
- **Canvas System**: HTML5 Canvas with WebGL overlay for effects
  
- **Permanent Additions**:
  - Thick black outlines (KidPix style, 4px stroke width)
  - High-contrast, primary colors from session color scheme
  - Shapes: circles, squares, triangles, stars, hearts (canvas-drawn, not images)
  - Animals: emoji representations (üê±üê∂üê¶üê†üê∞üêª) for simplicity, no image assets needed
  - Numbers: 1-10 in Comic Sans or web font, size range 40-120px
  - Symbols: Unicode characters (‚òÖ ‚ô• ‚óè ‚ñ† ‚ñ≤ ‚úø ‚òÄ ‚òæ) rendered as text
  - Words: baby words (BABA, MAMA, WOW, YAY, BOO, HI) in bold, fun fonts
  - Splatter/paint effects: random bezier curves with varying opacity
  
- **Animated Elements**:
  - Bouncing shapes that persist for 3-10 seconds
  - Moving text that scrolls across
  - Spinning/rotating elements
  - Growing/shrinking animations
  - Physics-based bounces
  
- **Background Effects**:
  - Full background color changes
  - Gradient shifts
  - Sparkle overlays
  - Star fields
  - Particle systems
  
- **WebGL/Shader Effects**:
  - Screen shake
  - Color distortions
  - Glitch effects
  - Trails and motion blur
  - Kaleidoscope patterns
  - Ripple effects
  - Rainbow chromatic aberration
  - Pixelation/mosaic effects

#### Color Scheme
- **Random Per Session**: Each jam gets a unique color palette
- **Palette Options**:
  - Primary colors (red, blue, yellow)
  - Neon (hot pink, electric blue, lime green)
  - Pastels (soft pink, baby blue, mint)
  - Earth tones (orange, brown, forest green)
  - Ocean (teal, navy, aqua)
  - Candy (magenta, purple, cyan)
  
- **Always Include**: Black for outlines, white for highlights

### 3. Session Management

#### Recording
- **Duration**: Sessions feel continuous and infinite to the user (no visible timer or limits)
- **Saved Duration**: Only last 3 minutes are retained (rolling buffer silently discards older data)
- **Recording Buffer**: Circular 3-minute buffer that continuously overwrites oldest events
- **Buffer Strategy**: As new events arrive, events older than 180 seconds are automatically removed
- **Data Captured**:
  - Timestamp of each keypress (milliseconds since jam start)
  - Key pressed (key code and character)
  - Assigned function that was triggered
  - Random seed for reproducibility (stored once at session start)
  - Audio events (including beat pattern starts/stops)
  - Canvas state snapshots every 10 seconds (for faster replay seeking)

#### Playback System
- **Replay Capability**: Recorded sessions can be replayed
- **Real-time Recreation**: Playback recreates both audio and visual in sync
- **Playback Controls**: (minimal, parent-facing)
  - Play/Pause
  - Download canvas as PNG
  - Download audio as WAV/MP3
  - Restart replay

#### Exiting Jam Mode
- **Hidden Exit**: Hold ESCAPE key for 5 seconds continuously
- **Visual Feedback**: Subtle progress indicator appears after 2 seconds
- **Exit Action**: Returns to landing modal overlay
- **Options Presented**:
  - "REPLAY YOUR JAM"
  - "DOWNLOAD CANVAS"
  - "DOWNLOAD AUDIO"
  - "START NEW JAM"

### 4. Session Protection
- **No Accidental Exits**: Single keypresses, clicks, or gestures don't end session
- **No Clear Canvas**: No way to accidentally clear work during jam
- **Full Screen Immersion**: No visible UI elements during jam
- **No Timer Visible**: 3-minute limit is hidden from user

## Technical Requirements

### Technology Stack
- **Frontend Framework**: Three.js for WebGL + React for UI/state management
- **Audio Engine**: Tone.js (Web Audio API wrapper) for synthesis and effects
- **Canvas Rendering**: HTML5 Canvas 2D + WebGL (Three.js) for shader effects
- **Build Tool**: Vite for fast dev and optimized builds
- **Language**: TypeScript for type safety
- **Styling**: CSS Modules or Styled Components (keep it playful)

### Architecture
- **Modular Design**:
  - `AudioEngine`: Manages synthesis, sounds, patterns
  - `VisualEngine`: Manages canvas rendering, animations
  - `ShaderEngine`: Manages WebGL effects via Three.js
  - `KeyboardMapper`: Random key assignment system
  - `SessionRecorder`: Captures and stores session data
  - `PlaybackEngine`: Recreates sessions from recordings
  - `ModalManager`: Handles UI overlays
  
### Performance Requirements
- **60 FPS**: Maintain smooth animation even with many elements
- **Audio Latency**: < 50ms from keypress to sound (target < 30ms)
- **Memory Management**: Clear old animations, limit simultaneous effects, dispose WebGL resources
- **Browser Tab Handling**: Properly suspend/resume audio context when tab loses focus
- **Asset Loading**: Graceful fallbacks if sound samples fail to load (synthesize tones only)
- **Mobile Support**: NOT in Phase 1 scope (keyboard-only focus)

### Data Storage
- **Session Format**: JSON structure containing:
  ```json
  {
    "id": "unique-session-id",
    "timestamp": "ISO-8601",
    "duration": 180,
    "seed": 12345,
    "colorScheme": "neon",
    "events": [
      {
        "time": 1.234,
        "key": "a",
        "function": "shape-circle",
        "params": {...}
      }
    ]
  }
  ```
  
- **Local Storage**: Phase 1 uses browser localStorage for session saving
- **Export Format**: 
  - Canvas: PNG (2000x2000px)
  - Audio: MP3 (compressed) or WAV (lossless)
