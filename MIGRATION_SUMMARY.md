## 🎯 Why Cloudflare Pages?

### Benefits Over Heroku

| Feature | Heroku Free | Cloudflare Pages |
|---------|-------------|------------------|
| **Cost** | Limited hours | ✅ Free unlimited |
| **Bandwidth** | Metered | ✅ Unlimited |
| **Cold Starts** | Yes (slow) | ✅ No (instant) |
| **CDN** | Not included | ✅ Global (200+ locations) |
| **HTTPS** | Included | ✅ Automatic |
| **Custom Domain** | Add-on | ✅ Easy setup |
| **Deployments** | Manual push | ✅ Auto on Git push |
| **Rollbacks** | Manual | ✅ One-click |
| **Build Speed** | Moderate | ✅ Fast |

### Perfect for DinkyTime Because:
- ✅ Pure static React app (no backend needed)
- ✅ Asset-heavy (sounds, canvas, shaders)
- ✅ Needs fast global delivery
- ✅ Requires HTTPS for Web Audio API
- ✅ Already own dinkytime.com domain

## 📋 Deployment Steps

### Option 1: Git Integration (Recommended)

```bash
# Push to GitHub/GitLab
git push origin main

# Go to Cloudflare Dashboard
# Connect repository
# Configure:
#   - Build command: npm run build
#   - Build output: dist
#   - Node version: 20.x
# Deploy!
```

**Automatic deployments** on every push to main.

### Option 2: Direct Upload

```bash
npm run build
npx wrangler pages deploy dist --project-name=dinkytime
```
