# BabyTime - Changelog

## Documentation Audit (October 24, 2025)

### Project Planning Phase
Initial specification and architecture documents created and audited by strict project manager review.

### Documents Created
- `PROJECT_SPEC.md` - Complete project specification
- `TECHNICAL_ARCHITECTURE.md` - System design and architecture
- `WORK_INSTRUCTIONS.md` - Step-by-step development guide
- `.cursorrules` - Cursor AI development guidelines
- `README.md` - Project overview and documentation
- `DEPLOYMENT_CHECKLIST.md` - Production deployment verification
- `CHANGELOG.md` - This file

### Critical Updates from Audit

#### PROJECT_SPEC.md
- **Clarified recording buffer**: Changed vague "continuous/infinite feeling" to explicit circular buffer behavior with 180-second window
- **Added canvas snapshots**: Specified 10-second keyframe intervals for faster replay seeking
- **Removed mobile support ambiguity**: Explicitly marked as NOT in Phase 1 scope (keyboard-only)
- **Added browser tab handling**: Specified audio context suspension/resume on focus loss
- **Clarified animal assets**: Using emoji (üê±üê∂üê¶üê†üê∞üêª) instead of images for simplicity
- **Updated timeline**: Increased from 24-34 hours to realistic 51-68 hours (1.5-2 weeks FT)
- **Added fallback strategies**: For asset loading failures (synth-only mode)

#### TECHNICAL_ARCHITECTURE.md
- **Enhanced rolling buffer**: Added implementation details (circular buffer, head/tail pointers, filtering)
- **Detailed audio recording**: Specified MediaRecorder setup with Tone.js destination stream
- **Added WebM format note**: Browser-native recording format (no MP3 conversion in Phase 1)
- **Improved server.js**: Added error handling, graceful shutdown, SPA routing support
- **Clarified fallbacks**: If MediaRecorder unavailable, visual-only session (no audio export)

#### WORK_INSTRUCTIONS.md
- **Added @types/node**: Required for Vite config path module
- **Fixed git branch**: Updated from `master` to `main` (modern Git default)
- **Added sound effect sources**: Freesound, Zapsplat, BBC, with licensing notes
- **Specified format requirements**: MP3 mono, 44.1kHz, normalized, < 1s duration
- **Updated timeline**: Aligned with realistic 51-68 hour estimate
- **Added Heroku troubleshooting**: Log viewing, version specification

#### .cursorrules
- **Enhanced memory management**: Specific dispose() calls for Tone.js and Three.js
- **Added error boundary guidance**: React ErrorBoundary component usage
- **Async operation handling**: Tone.start() requirements, Promise error handling
- **Loading state patterns**: Asset preloading with fallbacks
- **Production logging**: Use import.meta.env.DEV flag for conditional logs

#### README.md
- **Updated contact placeholders**: Marked GitHub links and email as TBD with note
- **Maintained feature completeness**: All Phase 1 features documented

#### New: DEPLOYMENT_CHECKLIST.md
- **Comprehensive pre-deployment checklist**: Code, testing, assets, build verification
- **Heroku setup steps**: Required files, environment, git configuration
- **Post-deployment verification**: Functionality, browser compatibility, performance
- **Monitoring guidance**: Heroku dashboard, logs, user feedback
- **Troubleshooting section**: Common issues and solutions
- **Success criteria**: Clear definition of "done" for Phase 1

### Key Decisions Documented

#### Technical
1. **Animals as emoji**: No image assets needed, simpler implementation
2. **WebM audio only**: Browser-native, no conversion libraries required
3. **Canvas snapshots every 10s**: Balance between replay smoothness and data size
4. **Circular buffer**: Simple array with filtering, no complex data structures
5. **No MP3 conversion**: Phase 1 limitation, accept WebM format

#### Scope
1. **Mobile explicitly out**: Keyboard-only focus for Phase 1
2. **MediaRecorder optional**: Graceful fallback to visual-only if unavailable
3. **Realistic timeline**: 51-68 hours, not 24-34 hours
4. **Sound effects optional**: Can function with Tone.js synths only

#### Best Practices
1. **Error boundaries**: Wrap engines in React error handling
2. **Async safety**: Always await Tone.start() before playing
3. **Resource disposal**: Explicit cleanup for Tone.js and Three.js
4. **Dev/prod logging**: Gate behind environment flags
5. **Graceful degradation**: App works with feature subsets

### Testing Requirements Added
- Audio context suspension on tab blur
- Asset loading failure scenarios
- localStorage quota exceeded handling
- MediaRecorder unavailability fallback
- WebGL unavailability fallback

### Documentation Improvements
- All vague statements clarified with specifics
- Implementation details added where missing
- Realistic time estimates provided
- Fallback strategies documented
- Error scenarios addressed

## Impact Statement

**This isn't just a changelog. It's a commitment.**

We're building software that might be a baby's first creative experience. That responsibility is HUGE. Every line of code, every animation curve, every sound envelope - it all matters.

Somewhere, a future Einstein is waiting to mash some keys.

Let's give them something beautiful. ‚ú®
